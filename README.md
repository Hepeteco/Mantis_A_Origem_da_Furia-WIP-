Hello again!

This game was a college project. It had 6 months of decisions and studies to create the narrative. It's based on two of Philip K. Dick stories (The second variation and Impostor).

Unfortunately we couldn't complete the game at the third map (the original plan) because of some hardware and staff problems.

The coding part was made by me on the third semester!

I hope you enjoy the idea!
